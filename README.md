# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Purpose

### The purpose of this analysis was to compare the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of a number of different supervised machine learning models in predicting credit risk of potential loan issuees.

## Results

The first four models were various methods of resampling data, while the last two were ensemble classifier methods. The following list shows the classification reports for each machine learning model's performance when ruin against the test data.

### 1. Naive Random Oversampling
